/*

Objective:
In this activity, you will reinforce the skill of creating and using variables
while practicing best practices in variable naming conventions through a hands-on,
interactive coding challenge.

The code snippet below may include:
  - Ambiguous or incorrect variable names.
  - Missing variables that need to be created.
  - Scenarios that require the use of clear and descriptive variable names.

You will:
  - Identify Issues: Review the provided code and identify any variable names that:
  - Are unclear or too vague (e.g., a, b, c).
  - Do not follow best practices (e.g., camelCase, descriptive naming).
  - Refactor the Code: Rename the variables and rewrite the program using descriptive names that clearly convey the variable's purpose.
  - Enhance the Program: Add at least two additional variables to improve the programâ€™s functionality or clarity.

Things to reflect on:
  - Why is it important to use meaningful variable names?
  - What are the common pitfalls to avoid when naming variables?
  - How do clear variable names benefit team collaboration?

// Problems with code: bad variable names (a, b, c, & d), didn't use camelCase, could've given more context with names to tell us what they are

// Old code
let a = "Alice";
let b = 5;
let c = 20;
let d = a + " bought " + b + " items for $" + c + ".";

console.log(d);

//New code
let name = "Alice";
let numberOfItems = 5;
let cost = "20";
let recap = name + " bought " + numberOfItems + " items for $" + cost + "."; 

console.log(recap);

// Enhance Program

let custName = "Alice";
let totalItems = 5;
let pricePerItem = 4;
let total = totalItems * pricePerItem;

let purchase = custName + " bought " + totalItems + " items at $" + pricePerItem + " each, totalling $" + total + ".";

console.log(purchase);
